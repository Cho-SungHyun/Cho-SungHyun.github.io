Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for
hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or
self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is
purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you.

The theme includes responsive layouts (`single`, `archive`, and
`splash` pages) that look great on mobile and desktop browsers.
