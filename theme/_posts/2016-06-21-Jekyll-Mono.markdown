Jekyll-Mono also comes with the option of setting up the color scheme of your blog. You can do this by editing _variables.scss that lies inside the _sass folder. You can change the main theme color by simply replacing the current hex color value of `$mono` with the one of your choice. A few main theme sample colors are included in there as comments. Apart from the main 
theme color you can also change the header link color, navbar hover color, hyperlink color as well as the color of the various headings.

For setup instructions please visit the Github [Repo](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono) and read the Readme.md file.
