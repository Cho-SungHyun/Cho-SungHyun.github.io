__s, or dunders, is a clean Jekyll Starter Theme based on [Underscores](https://github.com/automattic/_s)

## Why I create Dunders?

Whenever I search for a Jekyll Theme I found some project with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) or a structure of theme a little disorganized. I dont like disorder. :/

CSS files with several lines of code. HTML not semantic or JavaScript not very good.

This saddens me.

Because this, I made this scaffold to themes Jekyll!!!

Don't have CSS, don't have JS, and the HTML is clean to you add your structure. Is very basic structure, easy to change.

Use your imagination to build a awesome sites with Dunders.

## Who should use Dunders

Dunders is for people who want to create themes from zero with a simple initial structure.

Use if you want to implement:

- BEMCSS
- Atomic
- SMACSS
- SVG
- Structured Data (Schema.org)
- etc

It's for you to release your imagination.
