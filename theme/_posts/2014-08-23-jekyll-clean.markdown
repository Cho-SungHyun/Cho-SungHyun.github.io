A simple and clean Jekyll theme that's easy to modify and very modular
in component and element reuse. The theme works well on mobile devices
as well, using bootstrap for much of the heavy lifting.

This theme uses Disqus for comments and includes Google Analytics
support (both are disabled out of the box).

Check out the demo - that's the live github branch and exactly what
you'll get when you clone it.

Enjoy!
